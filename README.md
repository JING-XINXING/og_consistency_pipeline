# Consistency pipeline for hierarchies of orthologous groups

This repository contains the python implementation for the methodology described in:

# Content

The current version of the pipeline (v0.2) is a [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable) workflow written in python3, which relies on the python tree library [etetoolkit](http://etetoolkit.org) and the progress bar [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm), as well as on the following software to compute and reconcile gene trees with species trees:

- [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/linuxportable.html) for multiple sequence alignment
- [FastTree](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/#Install) for tree prediction
- [NOTUNG](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~durand/Notung/) for tree reconciliation

For convenience the binaries of the three tools have been included in the archive `bin.tar.gz`. We also added an example dataset from the [eggNOG database](http://eggnog.embl.de) in `data.tar.gz`. Currently the package structure is tied to how the eggNOG data is organized, but we plan to update the software in the coming weeks to a [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) based version, for easier application to other datasets.

The software has only been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 12/16/18.04). Other Unix systems might be suitable as well but binaries have to be adapted accordingly.

# Example execution

By running the `setup.py` script, the two archives are extracted and the small eggNOG related example dataset is generated. The data directory contains information regarding the Primates level of eggNOG and its two sublevels, Hominidae and Cercopithecoidea:

```
                             /-314294[prNOG-1][superfamily:Cercopithecoidea]
-9443[prNOG][order:Primates]--
                             \-9604[homNOG][family:Hominidae]
```

For the 15 member species of the Primates level (see `data/9443.primates.species.tsv`), the data directory includes FASTA sequences (in `data/fastafiles`) and orthologous group mappings (in `data/pickles`) as well as clades (in `data/clades`). 

- To test the consistency pipeline on the small example data (`test_data` directory), execute `test.sh`, which will make the three levels hierarchically consistent. The test dataset is limited to 40 tree computations, to run the full example dataset (`data` directory ~ 8000 Trees), an execution with several cores is strongly recommended (`-c` option, see final comment `test.sh`)
- **experimental** the same result from `test.sh` can be generated by using the Snakemake workflow. To run the workflow use the command `snakemake test_output/consistent_ogs/9443.tsv`. The result can be found in `test_output`. The final version of the workflow will use only the `config.yaml` configuration file.
